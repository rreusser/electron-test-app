# electron-test-app

> Just learning

First test with a sorta universal-ish app. Uses browserify. React. Live reloading. Runs as web server. Runs as electron dev app. And [deployed to the web](http://rickyreusser.com/electron-test-app/), naturally.
 
Organization still isn't totally clean, but it's a start. To run it:

```bash
$ npm run watch
$ npm run start
```
